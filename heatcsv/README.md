# Data Cleaning Report: Heart.csv
### 1. Introduction

The Heart Disease dataset is widely used to study cardiovascular health indicators and predict the likelihood of heart disease. It includes variables such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type. Raw medical data often contains missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, which can bias analysis and reduce model performance. Data cleaning was therefore necessary to prepare the dataset for accurate and reliable predictive modeling.

The project is divided into two main parts:

heart_.ipynb – Data cleaning & preparation.

heartml_.ipynb – Machine learning modeling & evaluation.

Supporting files:

heart.csv – Raw dataset.

heart_cleaned.pkl – Cleaned dataset for modeling.

### 2. Methods & Materials

Dataset: heart.csv
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data Cleaning Steps:

Loading & Inspection – Imported dataset, checked structure, column names, and data types.

Handling Missing Values – Replaced missing values in medical indicators with median imputation.

Removing Duplicates – Dropped duplicate patient records.

Data Type Corrections – Encoded categorical variables (sex, cp, fbs, thal) numerically.

Outlier Detection & Treatment – Capped extreme values in cholesterol and maximum heart rate (thalach) within medically acceptable ranges.

Standardization/Normalization – Scaled continuous variables (age, chol, trestbps, etc.) for comparability.

Feature Consistency – Standardized column names and corrected inconsistent entries.

### 3. Results
Cleaning Outcomes

Missing Values:

Cholesterol (chol): 6 missing values → imputed with median (240 mg/dL).

Resting blood pressure (trestbps): 3 missing values → imputed with median (130 mmHg).

Final dataset: 0 null values.

Duplicates Removed:

1 duplicate patient record removed.

Outliers Adjusted:

Cholesterol (chol):

Max value reduced from 603 → 400 after capping.

Skewness reduced from 1.89 → 0.76.

Maximum heart rate (thalach):

Max value reduced from 220 → 200.

Skewness reduced from 1.21 → 0.64.

Categorical Encoding:

Sex encoded: 0 = female, 1 = male.

Chest pain (cp): 0–3.

Fasting blood sugar (fbs): 0 = false, 1 = true.

Thalassemia (thal): 0–2.

Final Dataset Shape: (302 rows × 14 columns) after cleaning.

Random Forest and Logistic Regression showed the best balance of precision and recall.


### 4. Discussion

The cleaning process systematically addressed missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and unrealistic outliers. Imputation preserved sample size, while duplicate removal ensured dataset integrity. Outlier treatment reduced skewness in medical variables, making them more suitable for statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

Some limitations remain. Median imputation assumes central tendency reflects missing values, which may not always align with clinical reality. Similarly, outlier capping removes extreme but potentially valid medical cases. Future refinements could include domain-driven thresholds (e.g., medically validated cholesterol cutoffs), feature engineering (e.g., age group stratification), and class balancing to enhance predictive performance.

The cleaning process improved dataset reliability by addressing missing data, duplicates, and outliers. This reduced bias and skewness, leading to better model training conditions.
Machine learning results showed consistent predictive power across models, with ensemble methods like Random Forest performing particularly well.

Limitations:

Median imputation may not fully capture clinical variability.

Outlier capping may remove rare but valid patient cases.

Class imbalance and lack of feature engineering may affect model generalization.

Future improvements:

Domain-driven thresholds for medical features.

Feature engineering (e.g., age grouping, risk factors).

Balancing techniques (SMOTE, re-weighting).

### 5. Conclusion

The heart.csv dataset was successfully cleaned and is now complete, consistent, and ready for analysis. Missing values were imputed, categorical variables encoded, duplicates removed, and outliers treated. These improvements increase dataset reliability and ensure suitability for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning in heart disease risk classification.The project demonstrates the full data science pipeline:

Raw data (heart.csv) → Clean dataset (heart_cleaned.pkl) → Predictive models (heartml_.ipynb).

Data cleaning significantly improved dataset quality.

Machine learning models achieved strong predictive performance.

This workflow confirms that structured data cleaning and comparative modeling are essential steps toward reliable disease prediction.
