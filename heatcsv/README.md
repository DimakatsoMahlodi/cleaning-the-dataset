# Data Cleaning Report: Heart.csv
### 1. Introduction

The Heart Disease dataset is widely used to study cardiovascular health indicators and predict the likelihood of heart disease. It includes variables such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type. Raw medical data often contains missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, which can bias analysis and reduce model performance. Data cleaning was therefore necessary to prepare the dataset for accurate and reliable predictive modeling.

### 2.Methods & Materials.

### Dataset: heart.csv
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Loading & Inspection – Imported dataset, checked structure, column names, and data types.

Handling Missing Values – Replaced missing values in medical indicators (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure) with median imputation.

Removing Duplicates – Removed duplicate patient records to ensure unique entries.

Data Type Corrections – Encoded categorical variables (e.g., sex, chest pain type, fasting blood sugar) numerically for modeling.

Outlier Detection & Treatment – Capped extreme values in cholesterol and maximum heart rate within acceptable ranges to reduce skewness.

Standardization/Normalization – Normalized continuous variables (age, cholesterol, blood pressure) for comparability.

Feature Consistency – Standardized column names and corrected inconsistent entries.

### Results

Missing Values: All handled, resulting in 0 null values.

Duplicates: Successfully removed, ensuring each record is unique.

Outliers: Adjusted, reducing skewness in medical indicators.

Final Dataset: Clean, consistent, and normalized, ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

Final Shape: (rows × columns) after cleaning.

### 3. Discussion

Data cleaning addressed several quality issues, including missing values, duplicates, and unrealistic outliers. Imputation ensured no loss of patient data, while duplicate removal improved dataset integrity. Categorical encoding allowed clinical features to be integrated into predictive models.

However, limitations remain: imputing values introduces assumptions that may not fully capture clinical reality, and some features may oversimplify patient conditions. Additional preprocessing, such as feature engineering (risk categories, age groups) and class balancing, could improve downstream model accuracy.

### 4. Conclusion


The heart.csv dataset was successfully cleaned and is now ready for analysis. Missing values were handled, categorical variables encoded, duplicates removed, and outliers treated. These steps improved dataset reliability and prepared it for predictive modeling, particularly in heart disease risk classification.
