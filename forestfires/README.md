### 1 Understand the Dataset
forestfires.csv is a well-known UCI dataset with columns like X, Y, month, day, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, temp, RH, wind, rain, and area.

It records forest fire occurrences in a Portuguese forest, with meteorological and fire spread data. 
u khow the forestfire is commonly used in data science and machine learning and it also from the UIC machine learning repository. so each row represents information about a specific forest fire event, and each column contains details like the date, location, weather conditions, and the area burned by the fire.
AND it has 517 rows and 13 columns.

 ### 2. Check for Missing Data
Look for NaN, empty strings, or placeholder values like -999.

Decide how to handle them:

Drop rows if only a few are missing and theyâ€™re not crucial.

Fill in values (impute) if it makes sense (e.g., replace missing temperature with average).

 ### 3. Standardize Data Formats
Ensure month and day are consistent (convert month names to numbers, days to abbreviations or numbers).

Convert numerical columns to numeric data types (float or int).

### 4. Handle Outliers
Check for unrealistic values (e.g., negative temperature, impossible wind speed, huge area spikes).

Decide whether to remove or transform them (e.g., log-transform area to reduce skew).

### 5. Remove Duplicates
Check if any rows are exact duplicates.

Drop duplicates unless they represent genuine repeated events

### 6. Validate the Final Dataset
Confirm all values make sense.

Double-check there are no typos, inconsistent spellings, or strange symbols.
