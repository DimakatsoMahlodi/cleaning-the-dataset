## 1. Understand the Data First which is heart.csv

The heart.csv dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis.
 Missing values in numerical columns such as age, trestbps, chol, thalach, and oldpeak were imputed using the median, while categorical columns like sex, cp, fbs, restecg, exang, slope, ca, and thal were filled using the most frequent category. All categorical variables were verified for valid codes and corrected if necessary.


### 1. Handling Missing Values

Checked for null or missing values across all columns.

Found none (if any were present, they were either filled using mean/median/mode for numerical features or the most frequent value for categorical features).

### 2. Removing Duplicates

Scanned the dataset for duplicate rows.

Removed duplicates to avoid bias in model training.

### 3. Data Type Corrections

Ensured all categorical variables (e.g., sex, cp, fbs, restecg, exang, slope, thal) were stored as categorical types.

Verified numerical variables (age, trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak) had the correct numeric format.

### 4. Outlier Detection & Treatment

Checked distributions of continuous features (e.g., chol, trestbps, thalach).

Identified extreme outliers (e.g., very high cholesterol levels).

Decided whether to keep, cap, or remove outliers depending on their validition .

### Outliers 
 Outliers in the age, trestbps, chol, thalach, and oldpeak Numerical features were checked for outliers using both the IQR and Z-score methods; extreme but medically plausible values were retained, while erroneous entries were removed. After cleaning, the dataset contains consistent, valid values across all columns and is ready for exploratory analysis and machine learning modeling.

 The dataset is now fully cleaned, consistent, and prepared for reliable analysis or modeling.

### TO conclude i can say heart.csv is a dataset about heart health stored in a csv file.

So the exambles its contains patiens and their health. like  paitints age, sex, cholestrol, blood pressure, that has 303 rows and 14 columns.
:
### Conclusion

The cleaning process ensured that the heart.csv dataset is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analysis. Missing values and duplicates were handled, data types were corrected, categorical features were encoded, and continuous features were standardized. After these steps, the dataset is now well-prepared for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling of heart disease.
