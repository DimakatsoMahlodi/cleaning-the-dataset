### Understand the Dataset

forestfires.csv is a well-known UCI dataset with columns like X, Y, month, day, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, temp, RH, wind, rain, and area.

It records forest fire occurrences in a Portuguese forest, with meteorological and fire spread data. 
u khow the forestfire is commonly used in data science and machine learning and it also from the UIC machine learning repository. so each row represents information about a specific forest fire event, and each column contains details like the date, location, weather conditions, and the area burned by the fire.
AND it has 517 rows and 13 columns.

## 1. Loading the Dataset
- Imported the CSV using **Pandas** (`pd.read_csv("forestfires.csv")`).
- Inspected the first few rows (`df.head()`) and basic statistics (`df.info()`, `df.describe()`).

---

## 2. Handling Missing Values
- Checked for missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.
- No missing values were found in the original dataset.  
- If missing values were detected in other versions of the file, they would be:
  - Filled using mean/median/mode (numerical data) or most frequent category (categorical data), **or**
  - Removed if they were sparse and could not be reasonably imputed.

---

## 3. Removing Duplicates
- Checked for duplicates using:
  ```python
  df.duplicated().sum()

    ## 4. Final Verification

Confirmed:

No duplicates remain.

All columns have correct data types.

All categorical values are standardized.

Saved cleaned dataset to:

python
Copy
Edit
df.to_csv("forestfires_clean.csv", index=False)

### Conclusion

The forestfires.csv dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency by checking for duplicates, handling categorical values for month and day, correcting data types, and addressing outliers such as skewness in the area column. After cleaning, the dataset is now structured, reliable, and ready for further analysis and modeling.
