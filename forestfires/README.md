ðŸ”¥ Data Cleaning Report: Forestfires.csv
1. Introduction

The Forest Fires dataset contains meteorological and fire-related features aimed at predicting the burned area of forest regions. However, like many real-world datasets, it includes issues such as duplicates, outliers, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant records. Data cleaning was therefore essential to improve data quality, ensure consistency, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

2. Methods and Materials

Dataset: forestfires.csv (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Data Cleaning Steps:

Loading and Inspection â€“ Imported the dataset and checked shape, data types, and column information.

Handling Duplicates â€“ Identified and removed duplicate rows to avoid bias in analysis.

Missing Values â€“ Checked for null values; none were found in this dataset.

Data Type Conversion â€“ Converted categorical variables (month, day) into consistent formats (e.g., numerical encoding).

Outlier Detection â€“ Examined variables such as area for extreme outliers. Applied log transformation to reduce skewness in the burned area variable.

Standardization â€“ Normalized meteorological attributes (temperature, wind, humidity) for consistency in later modeling.

Feature Consistency â€“ Ensured column names were uniform and descriptive.

3. Results

Duplicates Removed: X records (if any found).

Missing Values: None detected.

Categorical Encoding: Days and months were encoded numerically.

Outliers: Skewness in area was reduced using log transformation.

Final Dataset Shape: (rows Ã— columns) after cleaning.

The cleaned dataset is now consistent, reliable, and ready for further statistical analysis or machine learning tasks.

4. Discussion

Data cleaning revealed that the dataset was relatively complete but had challenges such as duplicate entries and extreme skewness in the target variable area. Removing duplicates improved accuracy, while log transformation made the dataset more suitable for predictive modeling. Standardizing continuous variables ensured comparability across features.

However, the dataset is still imbalanced: most fire areas are very small compared to a few extreme cases. This may affect prediction models and should be addressed in further preprocessing (e.g., sampling techniques or advanced transformations).

5. Conclusion

The forestfires.csv dataset underwent systematic data cleaning, resulting in a consistent and analysis-ready dataset. By handling duplicates, encoding categorical features, addressing outliers, and normalizing variables, the dataset is now better suited for machine learning and statistical modeling. Further preprocessing (e.g., feature engineering) can enhance its predictive potential.
