#  Data Cleaning Report: Forestfires.csv
## 1. Introduction

The Forest Fires dataset contains meteorological and fire-related features aimed at predicting the burned area of forest regions. However, like many real-world datasets, it includes issues such as duplicates, outliers, inconsistent formats, and irrelevant records. Data cleaning was therefore essential to improve data quality, ensure consistency, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## 2. Methods and Materials

Dataset: forestfires.csv (from the UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Data Cleaning Steps:

Loading and Inspection – Imported the dataset and checked shape, data types, and column information.

Handling Duplicates – Identified and removed duplicate rows to avoid bias in analysis.

Missing Values – Checked for null values; none were found in this dataset.

Data Type Conversion – Converted categorical variables (month, day) into consistent formats (e.g., numerical encoding).

Outlier Detection – Examined variables such as area for extreme outliers. Applied log transformation to reduce skewness in the burned area variable.

Standardization – Normalized meteorological attributes (temperature, wind, humidity) for consistency in later modeling.

Feature Consistency – Ensured column names were uniform and descriptive.


## Result

Cleaning Outcomes

Duplicates Removed: 7 records were identified and removed.

Missing Values: None detected across all columns.

Categorical Encoding:

Days (mon–sun) encoded as integers 1–7.

Months (jan–dec) encoded as integers 1–12.

Outlier Treatment (Area Variable):

Original skewness of area: 12.84.

After log(x+1) transformation: 0.95.

Final Dataset Shape: 510 rows × 13 columns after cleaning.

| Step                | Result                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Duplicates removed  | 7 records                                  |
| Missing values      | 0 detected                                 |
| Skewness (area)     | 12.84 → 0.95 after log(x+1) transformation |
| Encoding            | Days (1–7), Months (1–12)                  |
| Final dataset shape | 510 rows × 13 columns                      |

## 4. Discussion

The data cleaning process confirmed that the dataset was largely complete; however, it presented specific challenges, including duplicate entries and extreme skewness in the target variable (area). Duplicate records were removed to prevent distortion of frequency counts, thereby improving overall accuracy. A logarithmic transformation was applied to the area variable, reducing skewness and enhancing the suitability of the data for predictive modeling. In addition, continuous variables were standardized to ensure comparability across features, facilitating fairer input to subsequent analyses.

Despite these improvements, the dataset remains imbalanced, as the majority of fire areas are very small compared to a limited number of extreme cases. This imbalance poses a risk of bias in prediction models and warrants further preprocessing, such as resampling strategies or advanced transformation methods, to mitigate its effects.

### 5. Conclusion

The forestfires.csv dataset underwent systematic data cleaning, resulting in a consistent and analysis-ready dataset. By handling duplicates, encoding categorical features, addressing outliers, and normalizing variables, the dataset is now better suited for machine learning and statistical modeling. Further preprocessing (e.g., feature engineering) can enhance its predictive potential.
